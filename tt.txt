FADE IN:

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM

A row of moving boxes lie on the floor of the room.  They
are drawn up in crayon to look like a miniature Western town.
The bedroom is lined with cloud wallpaper giving the
impression of sky.

One of the boxes has a children's illustrated "WANTED"
poster of a Mr. Potato Head taped to it.

A MR. POTATO HEAD DOLL is set in front of the poster.  The
VOICE OVER of ANDY, a 6-year-old boy, can be heard acting
out all the voices of the scene.

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            Alright everyone, this is a stick-
            up!  Don't anybody move!  Now empty
            that safe!

A GROUP OF TOYS have been crowded together in front of the
"BANK" box.

Andy's hand lowers a CERAMIC PIGGY BANK in front of Mr.
Potato Head and shakes out a pile of coins to the floor.  Mr.
Potato Head kisses the coins.

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            Ooh!  Money.  Money.  Money.
                   (kissing noises)


A porcelain figurine of the shepherdess, BO PEEP, is brought
into the scene.

                         ANDY (AS BO PEEP)
            Stop it!  Stop it, you mean old
            potato!

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            Quiet Bo Peep, or your sheep get
            run over!

The companion porcelain sheep are placed in the center of a
Hot Wheels track loop.

                         ANDY (AS SHEEP)
            Heeeeelp!  BAAAAA!  Heeeelp us!

                         ANDY (AS BO PEEP)
            Oh, no!  Not my sheep!  Somebody do
            something!

WOODY, a pull-string doll cowboy, enters into the scene
opposite the inanimate spud.

Andy's hand pulls on the ring in the center of Woody's back.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            Reach for the sky.

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            Oh, no!  Sheriff Woody!!

                         ANDY (AS WOODY)
            I'm here to stop you, One-Eyed Bart.

Andy's hand pulls out one of Mr. Potato Head's eyes.

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            Doooooh!  How'd you know it was me!

                         ANDY (AS WOODY)
            Are you gonna come quietly?

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            You can't touch me Sheriff!  I
            brought my attack dog with a built-
            in force field!

Andy places a TOY DOG, with a SLINKY for a mid-section, in
front of Mr. Potato Head and stretches him out.

                         ANDY (AS WOODY)
            Well I brought my DINOSAUR, who
            eats force field dogs!!

Andy reveals a PLASTIC TYRANNOSAURUS REX, who stomps on the
Slinky Dog.

                         ANDY (AS DINOSAUR)
            AAAAR!  ROAR-ROAR-ROAR!

                         ANDY (AS SLINKY DOG)
            YIPE!  YIPE-YIPE-YIPE!

                         ANDY (AS WOODY)
            You're goin' to jail, Bart.

Andy picks up Mr. Potato Head and places him in a baby crib
in the room.

A cardboard sign is taped to the bars with the word "JAIL"
written in crayon.

                         ANDY (AS WOODY)
            Say good-bye to the wife and
            tatertots.

Andy's 1-year-old sister, MOLLY, crawls over and picks up Mr.
Potato Head.  She sucks on him for a beat then proceeds to
pound the toy repeatedly against the rail of her crib,
forcing some of his parts loose.

Andy, wearing a cowboy hat himself, picks up Woody off the
floor.

                         ANDY
                   (pulling Woody's string)
            You saved the day again, Woody.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            You're my favorite deputy.

BEGIN TITLES

SONG "YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND IN ME" plays while Andy does
various activities with Woody:

-- Andy turns the Western town boxes around to reveal cows
drawn on the other side.  He grabs a jump rope and pretends
Woody is lassoing the cattle.

                         ANDY
            C'mon, let's wrangle up the cattle.

-- Andy then rides Woody around on an RC (remote control)
car, and herds the remaining "cow" boxes under Molly's crib.

INT. STAIRWELL

-- Andy places Woody on the top of the stairwell banister
allowing the doll to slide downstairs.  Andy races ahead and
catches him at the bottom.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS LIVING ROOM

-- Andy & Woody fall into the La-Z-Boy chair and spin around
and around.

Next, Andy uses the La-Z-Boy foot rest as a catapult.

Andy flings Woody across the room to the sofa.

                         ANDY
                   (raising his arms)
            Score!

SONG ENDS

Woody lies limp on the sofa while Andy is heard talking to
his mother.

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Wow!  Cool!

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Whadda ya think?

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!

ANGLE: THE ADJOINING DINING ROOM

MRS. DAVIS, Andy's thirty eight-year-old mom, has just
finished decorating the area with streamers and balloons.  A
banner is draped across the archway.  It reads: "Happy
Birthday Andy."

Woody's frozen face stares in the direction of the birthday
decorations.

                         ANDY
            Can we leave this up 'til we move?

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Well, sure, we can leave it up.

                         ANDY
            Yeah!

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Now go get Molly.  Your friends are
            going to be here any minute.

                         ANDY
            Okay.

Andy picks up Woody from the couch and runs upstairs.

                         ANDY
            It's party time, Woody!

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Andy and Woody enter the room.  Molly is still banging
Potato Head against her crib railing.  Andy tips Woody's hat
at her.

                         ANDY
            Howdy, Little Lady!

He deposits Woody on the bed and pulls his string one last
time.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            Somebody's poisoned the waterhole.

                         ANDY
                   (picking up Molly)
            C'mon, Molly.  Oh, you're getting
            heavy!
                   (to Woody)
            See ya later, Woody.

Andy exits.

END TITLES

Woody's eyes come to life.  The cowboy doll sits up, his
expression changing from a smile to worry.

                         WOODY
                   (to himself)
            Pull my string!  The birthday
            party's today?!

Woody thinks.

                         WOODY
                   (to the room)
            Okay, everybody.  Coast is clear.

The bedroom comes alive.  TOYS emerge from the toy box, the
closet, the shelves, etc... in a flurry of activity.

POTATO HEAD, his body parts strewn across the floor, sits
himself upright and begins to re-assemble himself.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Ages three and up.  It's on my box.
            Ages three and up!  I'm not
            supposed to be babysitting Princess
            Drool.

HAMM, the piggy bank, flips one last penny into his coin
slot.  Potato Head walks up to him.  All his facial pieces
are in the wrong slots.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Hey, Hamm!  Look!  I'm Picasso!
                         HAMM
            I don't get it.

Hamm walks away.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            You uncultured swine!
                   (to someone O.S.)
            What are you looking at, ya hockey
            puck?!

Potato Head walks past, revealing a hockey puck figurine.

Woody sits on the edge of the bed observing all the activity.
He turns to a plastic green army man, SARGENT, standing on
the night stand.

                         WOODY
            Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?

                         SARGENT
                   (saluting)
            Sir!  No Sir!

                         WOODY
            Okay, thank you.  At ease.

Woody hops off the bed.

                         WOODY
            Hey, Slinky?

                         SLINKY (O.S.)
            Right here, Woody!

A toy Slinky dog, SLINKY, appears from under the bed pushing
out a checker board set.  He begins to place the checkers on
the board.

                         SLINKY
            I'm red this time.

                         WOODY
            No, Slink --

                         SLINKY
            Oh...well alright, you can be red
            if you want.

                         WOODY
            Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad
            news.

                         SLINKY
            Bad news?!

                         WOODY
            Sh-h-h-h-h!!

Woody covers up Slinky's mouth, aware that the other toys in
the room are watching.  He leans in close to Slinky.

                         WOODY
                   (whispering)
            Just gather everyone up for a staff
            meeting and be happy!!

                         SLINKY
            Got it.

Slinky shuffles off.

                         WOODY
            Be HAPPY!

Slinky perks up his gait and LAUGHS HARD.

Woody proceeds in the other direction.  He passes a toy
ROBOT and SNAKE partially hidden under the bedspread.

                         WOODY
                   (to the room)
            Staff meeting, everybody.
                   (aside)
            Snake, Robot -- podium duty.

Robot and Snake come out from under the bed and reluctantly
follow Woody.

Woody walks past an Etch-A-Sketch, ETCH, going the other
direction.

                         WOODY
            Hey Etch!  Draw!

Both Etch and Woody whip around like gunfighters.

Before Woody can fully extend his arm out, the Etch-A-Sketch
etches a gun on its screen.

                         WOODY
                   (pretending to be shot)
            Oh!! You got me again, Etch! You've
            been working on that draw.  Fastest
            knobs in the west.

Slinky passes a group of toys on the floor.

                         SLINKY
            Got a staff meeting, you guys, come
            on, let's go!

Robot and Snake begin constructing a podium made out of
Legos and a Tinker Toy tub while Woody searches the floor.

                         WOODY
            Now where is that -- ?  Aw, hey,
            who moved my doodle pad way over here?

Woody spots the doodle pad on the floor by the desk and
walks over to it.  As he reaches down to pick it up...

REX, the plastic dinosaur, jumps out to scare Woody.

                         REX
            ROOAAAARR!!!

                         WOODY
                   (unaffected)
            Oh, how ya doin', Rex?

Rex suddenly turns timid.

                         REX
            Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.

                         WOODY
            I was close to being scared that time.

Woody heads back to the podium.  Rex follows.

                         REX
            I'm going for fearsome here, but I
            just don't feel it.  I think I'm
            just coming off as annoying.

A crook suddenly grabs Woody's neck and jerks him towards BO
PEEP, the porcelain figurine.

                         WOODY
                   (choking)
            Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.

                         BO PEEP
            I wanted to thank you, Woody, for
            saving my flock.

                         WOODY
                   (blushing)
            Oh, hey - it was nothing.

                         BO PEEP
            Whadda ya say I get someone else to
            watch the sheep tonight?

                         WOODY
                   (very flustered)
            Heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, I...

Bo saunters back towards her lamp stand, passing a stack of
ABC blocks.

                         BO PEEP
            Remember, I'm just a couple of
            blocks away.

Woody is left lovestruck.

All the rest of the toys in the room are filing past Slinky.

                         SLINKY
            Come on, come on!  Smaller toys up
            front.

Woody remains lovestruck in the middle of the room.

                         SLINKY
            Hey, Woody!  C'mon!

Woody snaps out of his trance and rushes over to the podium.

The toys crowd together as Woody steps up to the podium.
MIKE, a toy tape recorder, waddles up next to Woody and
indicates his microphone.

                         MIKE
            Ahem!

                         WOODY
                   (grabbing microphone)
            Oh, thanks, Mike.
                   (to the crowd)
            Okay --

SFX: FEEDBACK

                         WOODY
                   (to Mike)
            Oh, whoa, step back --

Mike waddles back a step to stop the feedback.

                         WOODY
            Hello?  Check?  Better?  Great.
            Everybody hear me?  Up on the
            shelf, can you hear me?  Great!
            Okay, first item today...oh, yeah.
            Has everyone picked a moving buddy?

The toys all MOAN.

                         HAMM
            Moving buddy?!  You can't be serious!

                         REX
            Well I didn't know we were supposed
            to have one already.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
                   (waving his arm out
                   its socket)
            Do we have to hold hands?

The toys LAUGH and SNICKER.

                         WOODY
            Oh, yeah, you guys think this is a
            big joke.  We've only got one week
            left before the move.  I don't want
            any toys left behind.  A moving
            buddy -- if you don't have one, get
            one!
                   (checking the pad)
            Alright, next...uh...oh, yes.
            Tuesday night's "Plastic Corrosion
            Awareness" meeting was, I think, a
            big success and we want to thank Mr.
            Spell for putting that on for us.
            Thank you, Mr. Spell.

The words "You're welcome" scroll across Mr. Spell's display
screen as he speaks.

                         MR. SPELL
            You're welcome.

                         WOODY
            Ok, uh...oh yes.  One minor note
            here...
                   (under his breath)
            Andy's birthday party's been moved
            to today.
                   (full voice)
            Next we have --

The toys all PANIC.

                         REX
            What?!  Whadda ya mean, the party's
            today?!  His birthday's not 'til
            next week!!

                         HAMM
            What's going on down there?  Is Mom
            losing her marbles?!

                         WOODY
            Well, obviously she wanted to have
            the party before the move.  I'm not
            worried.  You shouldn't be worried.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Of course Woody ain't worried!
            He's been Andy's favorite since
            kindergarten!

                         SLINKY
            Hey, hey!  Come on, Potato Head!
            If Woody says it's all right, then,
            well, darnit, it's good enough for
            me.  Woody has never steered us
            wrong before.

While Slinky speaks, Potato Head takes off his mouth and
mimes kissing his own butt.

                         WOODY
            C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and
            birthday we go through this.

                         REX
            But what if Andy gets another
            dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just
            don't think I can take that kind of
            rejection.

                         WOODY
            Hey, listen, no one's getting
            replaced.  This is Andy we're

Woody steps down from the podium and walks towards the crowd.

                   (continued)
            It doesn't matter how much we're
            played with.  What matters is that
            we're here for Andy when he needs
            us.  That's what we're made for.
            Right?
Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.

                         HAMM
            Pardon me.  I hate to break up the
            staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE!
            Birthday guests at three o'clock!

                         WOODY
            Stay calm, everyone!!

Too late.  The toys PANIC and stampede over Woody towards
the bedroom window, leaving him alone on the floor.

                         WOODY
            Uh, meeting adjourned.

The toys all crowd around the bedroom window, trying to get
a peek outside.

                         HAMM
            Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at
            all those presents?!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            I can't see a thing!

Unable to see over the crowd, Potato Head pulls his eyes out
of his head and holds them up over the other toys.

ANGLE: TOY'S POV OF ANDY'S FRONT YARD

CHILDREN file towards the front door carrying presents.

                         HAMM
            Yessir, we're next month's garage
            sale fodder for sure.

                         REX
                   (panicked)
            Any dinosaur-shaped ones?

                         HAMM
            Ah, for crying out loud, they're
            all in boxes, you idiot!

The presents keep coming.

                         REX
            They're getting bigger.

                         SLINKY
            Wait!  There's a nice little one
            over there!

At first, the kid's present appears to be a little box, but
then the kid turns -- the present is four feet long.  The
toys SCREAM.

                         MR. SPELL
            Spell the word "trashcan."

                         REX
            We're doomed!

Down on the floor, Woody smacks his hand to his forehead in
surrender.

                         WOODY
            Alright!  Alright!

The toys turn inside and look down at Woody.

                         WOODY
                   (continued)
            If I send out the troops, will you
            all calm down?

                         REX
            Yes!  Yes!  We promise!

                         WOODY
            Okay, save your batteries!

                         HAMM
            Eh, very good, Woody.  That's using
            the old noodle.

Woody jumps up onto Andy's bed and turns to the Sargent on
the nightstand.

                         WOODY
            Sargent.  Establish a recon post
            downstairs.  Code red.  You know
            what to do.

                         SARGENT
            Yes SIR!

The green army man hops down to the floor where a "BUCKET O'
SOLDIERS" sits.

                         SARGENT
            Alright men, you heard him.  Code
            Red!  Repeat: We are at Code Red!
            Recon plan Charlie.  Execute!
            Let's move move move!!

THE GREEN ARMY MEN file out of the bucket and march in
formation across the bedroom floor.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Andy's door creaks open and a lone army man ventures forth
to make sure the coast is clear.  Satisfied, he motions for
the others to proceed.  Squads of soldiers march into the
hall carrying a baby monitor and a jump rope.

The army men each leapfrog behind the stairway banisters and
hold their positions while the Sargent surveys the scene
below through his binoculars.

ANGLE: SARGENT'S BINOCULAR VIEW OF DOWNSTAIRS

Directly below, Mrs. Davis passes through the hallway
rounding up Andy and all his birthday guests.

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Okay, c'mon kids!  Everyone in the
            living room.  It's almost time for
            the presents.

Once Mrs. Davis and the children are out of sight, the
Sargent motions to his men with a silent hand signal.

TWO PARATROOPERS jump out through the railing, parachuting
down to the floor below.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

The paratroopers sweep the area with their plastic rifles,
then give the "all clear" sign.

The jump rope is lowered, and more soldiers rappel down.

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM

The toys race towards the nightstand where Woody has placed
the receiving half of the baby monitor.

                         WOODY
            And this --
                   (turning on the baby monitor)
            -- is how we find out what is in
            those presents.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY

The green army men march in formation across the floor when
suddenly...

SFX: FOOTSTEPS

Can be heard approaching from behind the connecting kitchen
door.  Immediately the Sargent signals for his men to freeze
in their various classic action poses.

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Okay, who's hungry?  Here come the
            chips.  I've got Cool Ranch and
            Barbeque --

The door opens and Mrs. Davis' foot comes down hard on top
of a soldier.

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Owww!  What in the world -- ?  Oh,
            I thought I told him to pick these up.

With a sweep of her foot, she brushes the army men out of
her path and continues on to the living room.

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM

                         REX
            Shouldn't they be there by now?
            What's taking them so long?!

                         WOODY
            Hey, these guys are professionals.
            They're the best.  C'mon, they're
            not lying down on the job.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY

As soon as Mom is gone, the Sargent motions for his men to
proceed toward a nearby houseplant that looks into the
living room.

The Sargent then notices an injured soldier struggling to
drag himself forward -- a casualty of Mrs. Davis' foot.  The
Sargent helps the injured soldier to his feet.

                         WOUNDED SOLDIER
                   (moans)
            Go on without me.  Just go!

                         SLINKY
            A good soldier never leaves a man
            behind.

The Sargent motions to the remaining men above.  They lower
themselves via jump rope, riding the baby monitor.  Once
downstairs, they hustle the baby monitor towards the
houseplant.  Suddenly...

A BALL

bounces into the hallway, followed by the sound of footsteps
and kid clamor.

The Sargent, supporting his wounded man, reaches the plant,
right on the heels of the squad with the baby monitor.  They
conceal themselves in the house plant just before the
children run by.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS - HOUSE PLANT - CONTINUOUS

While the baby monitor is set in place, A MEDIC evaluates
the wounded soldier and gives the "thumb's up" signal.

The Sargent scans the party with his binoculars.

The pile of brightly wrapped gifts sits atop the living room
coffee table.

                         SARGENT (O.S.)
            There they are.

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM

The toys perk up as STATIC suddenly emits from the baby
monitor.

                   (over monitor)
            The bow's coming off...he's ripping

            Ok, second present...it appears to

The toys CHEER WITH RELIEF.

                         HAMM
            Yeah, alright!!

Hamm gives Potato Head a congratulatory pat on the back,
sending his facial features flying.

            Hey, watch it!

The platoon is preparing to exit the plant when...

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Wait a minute.  Oooh, what do we
            have here?!

The Sargent lifts his binoculars back to his eyes.

Mrs. Davis can be seen opening the closet and pulling out
another large present.

cutting off the Sargent.

            It's a WHAT?! WHAT IS IT?!!!

Rex grabs a leg of the nightstand and shakes it, making the
monitor drop to the floor.  The impact causes the batteries
to roll out.

                         REX
            Oh, no!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD

Everyone rushes to the fallen monitor.  Potato Head tries to
correctly insert the batteries.

Frantic, Rex slams into a trashcan and falls over.

Everyone scurries to their places as the KIDS' FOOTSTEPS
grow louder.

Woody falls limp in his spot on the bed just as...

Andy's bedroom door flies open and a flood of children's
feet rush in.

Woody is flung off Andy's pillow and slides, unnoticed, down
the gap between the bed and the back wall.

            Quick!  Make a space!  This is

            Oh, yeah!

The kids all run out as fast as they entered, SLAMMING THE

The toys slowly come to life and make their way toward the bed.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD

            Woody?  Who's up there with you?

Woody crawls out from under the bed.  The toys are shocked
to discover him there.

            I'm sure Andy was just a little
            excited, that's all.  Too much cake
            and ice cream, I suppose.  It's
            just a mistake.

            Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in

            No one is getting replaced.

The toys give each other a look of doubt.

            whatever it is up there a nice, big
            "Andy's Room" welcome.

Woody climbs slowly up the side of the bed, peeking over the
edge.  His eyes widen at the sight of...

BUZZ LIGHTYEAR

We see Buzz as Woody does - an expensive looking space age
action figure, covered with buttons and stickers from head
to toe.  The imposing "G.I. Joe-sized" doll stands heroically
in the center of the bed, his back to Woody.

Woody GULPS.

Buzz comes alive and looks around.

            read me?
                   (to himself)
            Why don't they answer?!!
Just then, Buzz catches sight of his ripped packaging.  The
box is designed to look like a spaceship.

                         BUZZ
                   (GASP)
            My ship!!

He runs up to the box and investigates the damage.

                         BUZZ
            Blast!  This'll take weeks to repair!

Buzz flips open a plastic compartment on his arm -- his
wrist communicator.

                         BUZZ
            Buzz Lightyear Mission Log.
            Stardate 4072: My ship has run off
            course en route to sector 12.  I've
            crash landed on a strange planet.
            The impact must have awoken me from
            hyper-sleep.

Buzz springs up and down on the squishy surface of the bed.

                         BUZZ
                   (into communicator)
            Terrain seems a bit unstable...

He taps the sticker of controls on his wrist communicator.

                         BUZZ
                   (into communicator)
            No read-out yet if the air is
            breathable... and there seems to be
            no sign of intelligent life
            anywhere --

ANGLE: BUZZ'S POV THROUGH HIS HELMET

Woody's face suddenly pops into view.

                         WOODY
            Hello-o-o...

                         BUZZ
            HO-YAAAHH!!!

Buzz jumps back, taking a fighting stance.  He presses a
button on his arm that turns on a red "laser beam" light on
his wrist.  Buzz aims the red beam on Woody's forehead and
holds it there.

                         WOODY
            Aaaaaaah!  Whoa, hey, whoa, did I
            frighten you?  Didn't mean to.
            Sorry.  Howdy!  My name is Woody
            and this is Andy's room.  That's
            all I wanted to say, and also,
            there has been a bit of a mix-up.
            This is my spot, see, the bed here --

While Woody is speaking, Buzz notices the sheriff's badge on
Woody's vest.

                         BUZZ
                   (de-activating his
                   laser beam)
            Local law enforcement!  It's about
            time you got here.  I'm Buzz
            Lightyear, Space Ranger, Universe
            Protection Unit.  My ship has crash
            landed here by mistake.

Buzz begins walking around the bed, surveying the situation.
Woody tries to keep up.

                         WOODY
            Yes, it is a mistake, because, you
            see, the bed, here, is my spot.

                         BUZZ
            I need to repair my turbo boosters.
            Do you people still use fossil
            fuels, or have you discovered
            crystalic fusion?

                         WOODY
            Well, let's see, we've got double
            A's --

                         BUZZ
            Watch yourself!!

Buzz shoves Woody down on the bed and re-activates his wrist
laser.

                         BUZZ
                   (continued)
            Halt!  Who goes there?!

The other toys are peeking over the edge of the bed.

                         REX
            Don't shoot!  It's okay!  Friends!

                         BUZZ
                   (to Woody)
            Do you know these life forms?

                         WOODY
            Yes.  They're Andy's toys.

                         BUZZ
            Alright, everyone.  You're clear to
            come up.

Buzz walks over to the toys.

                         BUZZ
            I am Buzz Lightyear.  I come in peace.

Rex steps forward and eagerly shakes Buzz's hand.

                         REX
            Oh, I'm so glad you're not a dinosaur!

                         BUZZ
            Why, thank you...
                   (pulls away)
            Now thank you all for your kind
            welcome.

                         REX
            Say!  What's that button do?

                         BUZZ
            I'll show you.

Buzz presses a button on his chest.

                         BUZZ (SAMPLED VOICE)
            Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

The toys all GASP IN AWE.

                         SLINKY
            Hey, Woody's got something like
            that.  His is a pullstring, only
            it --

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Only it sounds like a car ran over it.

                         HAMM
            Oh yeah, but not like this one.
            This is a quality sound system.
            Probably all copper wiring, huh?
            So, uh, where are you from?
            Singapore?  Hong Kong?

                         BUZZ
            Well...no, actually I'm stationed
            up in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector
            4.  As a member of the elite
            Universe Protection Unit of the
            Space Ranger Corps, I protect the
            galaxy from the threat of invasion
            from the Evil Emperor Zurg, sworn
            enemy of the Galactic Alliance.

As Buzz speaks, Woody glances down at the box in which Buzz
arrived.

ANGLE: BACK OF BUZZ'S BOX

There is a cartoon drawing of Buzz giving the exact, word-
for-word spiel that Buzz is now giving.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Oh, really?  I'm from Playskool.

                         REX
            And I'm from Mattel.  Well, I'm not
            actually  from Mattel, I'm actually
            from a smaller company that was
            purchased in a leveraged buy-out.
            Well, I don't really understand the
            financials, but...

Woody walks over to Bo Peep.

                         WOODY
            You'd think they've never seen a
            new toy before.

                         BO PEEP
            Well sure, look at him.  He's got
            more gadgets on him then a Swiss
            army knife.

Slinky presses the button on Buzz's arm, activating his
laser light.  Buzz quickly pulls his arm away.

                         BUZZ
            Ah, ah, ah, please be careful!  You
            don't want to be in the way when my
            laser goes off.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Hey, a laser!  How come you don't
            have a laser, Woody?

                         WOODY
            It's not a laser!  It's a little
            lightbulb that blinks!

                         HAMM
            What's with him?

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Laser-envy.

                         WOODY
            All right, that's enough.  Look,
            we're all very impressed with
            Andy's new toy --

                         BUZZ
            Toy?

                         WOODY
            T-O-Y.  Toy.

                         BUZZ
            Excuse me, I think the word you're
            searching for is Space Ranger.

                         WOODY
            The word I'm searching for I can't
            say because there's pre-school toys
            present.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?

                         REX
            Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear?  Now I'm
